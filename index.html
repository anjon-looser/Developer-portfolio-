            <h3>Journey of a web developer</h3>
            <p>
                I started learning how to code four years ago. When I started, I knew that I wanted to build websites and apps. I figured I’d learn what I needed and make some cool stuff to land an entry level developer job. What I didn’t anticipate is how many tools there were to choose from, and there wasn’t much direction on where to start.Choosing a code editor, using the command line, version control, and not to mention learning the tech jargon made it hard to start.

        <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
        <p>There are A LOT of languages and tools you can use to build for the web. All of them have their benefits, and are maintained by tons of super smart people. While this is great for pushing the web forward, it’s confusing and overwhelming to startIf know HTML, CSS, and Javascript on a deep level, you will be able to create anything on the web.</p>

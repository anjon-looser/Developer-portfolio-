            <h3>Journey of a web developer</h3>
            <p>
                I started learning how to code four years ago. When I started, I knew that I wanted to build websites and apps. I figured I’d learn what I needed and make some cool stuff to land an entry level developer job. What I didn’t anticipate is how many tools there were to choose from, and there wasn’t much direction on where to start.Choosing a code editor, using the command line, version control, and not to mention learning the tech jargon made it hard to start.

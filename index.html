            <h3>Journey of a web developer</h3>
            <p>
                I started learning how to code four years ago. When I started, I knew that I wanted to build websites and apps. I figured I’d learn what I needed and make some cool stuff to land an entry level developer job. What I didn’t anticipate is how many tools there were to choose from, and there wasn’t much direction on where to start.Choosing a code editor, using the command line, version control, and not to mention learning the tech jargon made it hard to start.

        <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
        <p>There are A LOT of languages and tools you can use to build for the web. All of them have their benefits, and are maintained by tons of super smart people. While this is great for pushing the web forward, it’s confusing and overwhelming to startIf know HTML, CSS, and Javascript on a deep level, you will be able to create anything on the web.</p>

                Strive for ten hours of real coding each week. That means in the editor, slinging divs, and writing methods. Podcasts, tutorials, and reading blogs aren’t part of that ten. Don’t go over and definitely don’t go under. There’s a certain amount of time it takes for the concepts to sink in, so a steady pace will level up your skills faster.

                60 hours This is where you take everything you’ve learned so far and bring it together to build some pretty cool things. I recommend going through Wes Bos’s Javascript 30 course to get your feet wet in a variety of projects.
